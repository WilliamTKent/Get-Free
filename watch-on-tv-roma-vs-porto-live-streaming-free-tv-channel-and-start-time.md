While both teams have a sub-par record in crunch-time European competition, failing to reach the last 16 would be an embarrassment. The Giallorossi, who have the best defensive record in the Europa League, made the semis last season, while new Porto coach Martin Anselmi can count on prolific marksman Samu Aghehowa, one of the league phase top scorers.

Porto have home advantage at the Estadio do Dragao for today's first leg, having finished 18th in the standings, three positions below their opponents. That theoretically hands Roma the advantage, as Claudio Ranieri's men will know exactly what's required of them in the return fixture next week.
